## DeepLearning for leaf_Disease Detection of Tomato leaves  
## train a deep neural network to identify 9 disease of leaf diseases of Tomato plant.
This Model analyze 11118 images of Tomato leaves,
15607 for train and validate the model and 911 image for testing the output of the model
this set of images spread of 6 class labels assigned to them. Each classlabel is a disease pair,  
and we make a Neoral network to predict the disease pair given just the image of the plantleaf.  
the size of the images is 256256 pixels and we resize them to 120120 10207-911
